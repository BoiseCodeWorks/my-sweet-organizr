Getting Started
===============

Fork and clone this repo to your source directory

> cd my-sweet-organizr
```

Once you are in the my-sweet-organizr directory you are going to need bower

bower is a package manager that we can use to easily install our dependencies for our projects

to install bower

- from your command line/terminal

```terminal
> npm i -g bower
``` 

then to get the dependencies that this project uses type

```terminal
> bower i
```
Make sure you are in the project directory something like c:/source/projects/my-sweet-organizr

Now serve up your project and you should be ready to go.
